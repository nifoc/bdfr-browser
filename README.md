# BdfrBrowser

Maybe some else finds this useful.

It's a very crude and quickly thrown together browser for [BDFR](https://github.com/aliparlakci/bulk-downloader-for-reddit) dumps.

## Known Issues

- Directories with many posts (per month) are slow to load
- The HTML templates are very much a work in progress
